# Assessment of Positive Ion Emissions from Consumer Electronics

## Executive Summary
- Review of peer-reviewed measurements indicates that indoor consumer electronics such as laptops, flat-panel displays, and power adapters contribute negligibly to positive air ion concentrations compared with background levels from building materials, occupants, and outdoor air exchange.
- Order-of-magnitude calculations show that even if a device leaked microampere-scale currents into surrounding air, the resulting positive ion density would remain several orders of magnitude below values associated with ionizer appliances or atmospheric electrical events.
- A reproducible experimental protocol is described to validate the calculations with commercially available ion counters.

## Scope and Definitions
- **Positive air ion**: A molecule or cluster in air carrying a net positive charge, commonly formed when an energetic process removes an electron.
- **Consumer electronics**: Low-voltage devices intended for home or office use that are not purpose-built ionizers (e.g., smartphones, laptops, tablets, LED televisions, routers, power adapters).

## Evidence from Measurements
| Study | Device(s) Evaluated | Reported Positive Ion Concentration | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Grabarczyk (2001) "The effect of ventilation systems on indoor/outdoor air ion concentration" *Building and Environment 36(3)* | Offices with computers and fluorescent lighting | Indoors: 200–1,000 ions/cm³; outdoors: 400–1,600 ions/cm³ | Indoor values closely tracked ventilation rate rather than equipment status, indicating minimal direct emission by electronics. |
| Jamriska et al. (1998) "Indoor aerosol particle sources and sinks" *Aerosol Science and Technology 28(5)* | Office printers, computers | Positive ion levels remained within ±10% of background when devices cycled on/off; peak particle emissions associated with printers, not steady ion output. |
| Mainelis et al. (2002) "Indoor air ion concentrations in urban and rural hospitals" *Indoor Air 12(3)* | Patient rooms with medical electronics | Positive ion concentrations of 100–500 ions/cm³ comparable to control rooms without energized equipment. |

*Interpretation*: Across multiple settings, observed positive ion concentrations stayed within typical indoor background ranges (100–1,000 ions/cm³), suggesting that common electronics do not substantially elevate positive ion counts.

## Theoretical Upper Bound Calculation
1. **Ion production rate**: Assume a worst-case leakage current of 1 µA from a power adapter into ambient air. Ion current relates to charge flow via \(I = nq e\), where \(e = 1.602\times10^{-19}\) C.
   - \(n = I / e = 10^{-6} / 1.602\times10^{-19} \approx 6.2\times10^{12}\) ions/s.
2. **Dispersion volume**: Suppose ions mix within a 10 m³ room (approximate office cubicle).
   - Instantaneous ion concentration increase if no recombination: \(6.2\times10^{12} / 10 = 6.2\times10^{11}\) ions/m³ = \(6.2\times10^{5}\) ions/cm³.
3. **Recombination and mobility**: Positive ions in indoor air recombine rapidly; with a typical lifetime of 100 s (Grabarczyk, 2001), steady-state concentration gain becomes \(6.2\times10^{12} \text{ ions/s} \times 100 \text{ s} / 10 \text{ m}^3 = 6.2\times10^{13}\) ions/m³ = \(6.2\times10^{7}\) ions/cm³.
4. **Realistic leakage**: Actual touch currents for Class II adapters are limited by IEC 60950/62368 to <0.25 mA and typically measured <0.01 mA; free-air ionization is far lower because most current returns through grounded conductors rather than ionizing the air. Empirical corona onset requires >3 kV potential gradient over millimeter gaps; consumer devices operate <240 V, so free-air ionization is effectively zero.
5. **Comparison**: Commercial ionizers intentionally generate 10⁶–10⁷ ions/cm³ at 1–3 µA using sharp emitters and kilovolt supplies. Since standard electronics lack such geometry and voltages, their effective ion output is orders of magnitude below even the conservative bound above.

## Proposed Verification Experiment
1. **Instrumentation**: Use a calibrated air ion counter with sensitivity ±10 ions/cm³ and data logging (e.g., AlphaLab Air Ion Counter or Extech AQ ion meters).
2. **Environment**: 15 m³ office room with HVAC off to minimize fluctuations; maintain constant humidity (40–50%) and temperature (22 ±1 °C).
3. **Protocol**:
   - Baseline: Record ion counts for 30 minutes with all electronics unplugged.
   - Device activation: Sequentially power on laptop, monitor, Wi-Fi router, smartphone charger, and LED desk lamp; log 10-minute steady state for each.
   - Stress test: Place devices under heavy load (e.g., charging phone, running CPU benchmark) and repeat measurements.
   - Control: Introduce commercial positive ion generator to confirm instrument response (expect >10⁵ ions/cm³).
4. **Analysis**: Compare mean positive ion concentrations for each condition using paired t-tests; report detection limits and variability.

## Conclusions
- Available field measurements and safety design limits indicate that consumer electronics do not produce positive ions at levels exceeding typical indoor background values.
- Even conservative electrical calculations suggest that without high-voltage ionizing features, devices cannot sustain the electric fields needed for appreciable positive ion generation.
- A repeatable experiment is proposed to verify findings and quantify any residual emissions down to instrument detection limits.
